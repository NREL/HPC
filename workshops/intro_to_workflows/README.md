# Intro to Workflow Management Systems

What is a workflow? Why should I use a workflow management system? This presentation will provide a high-level overview of workflow management systems (WMS), and the benefits they can provide to researchers. Features such as automatic parallelization of tasks, portability between computational resources, and increased reproducibility of analysis are just some of the many reasons to use a WMS. Picking a WMS to use can be a daunting task as there are many options to choose from. Several popular WMS will be surveyed and methods for assessing systems that may be a good fit for your work will be discussed. Come and learn how workflows can benefit your research!
