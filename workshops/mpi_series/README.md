# Message Passing Interface Library (MPI) 4 Part Series

##Session 1: Introduction

The first session will introduce MPI. We will give a background, show some sources of Documentation. We will show the classic "Hello world" program in MPI running on multiple processors. We will discuss Basic communications and show a simple send and receive program where messages are passed between processors. We will be running examples in the official languages supported by MPI, C and Fortran. Also, we will briefly discuss support for Python, R, and Java.  Source code and scripts will be provided that can be run on Eagle.
