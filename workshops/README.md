In this introduction to Jupyter, we will discuss what Jupyter is, why you may 
want to use Jupyter, and how you may utilize notebooks on the various available 
NREL compute resources. This workshop includes a live demonstration with methods 
for using JupyterHub on Eagle (Europa), Jupyter notebooks on Eagle nodes, as well as 
sample notebooks and cluster submission scripts.
