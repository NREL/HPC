# NREL HPC - Using git and github

Please consult our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about contributing to the documentation 
and code contained within this repo using git.

You probably have heard of git through the 
popular git-repository hosting web-service [GitHub](https://github.com). GitHub (the the hosting service) is to git 
(the open-source version control software) what the internet is to computers&mdash;git is used locally to track 
incremental development and modifications to a collection of files, and GitHub gets those changes to serve as a 
synchronized, common access point. GitHub also has social aspects, like tracking who changed what and why. There are 
other git hosting services like [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) which are similar to GitHub but offer slightly different 
features.
