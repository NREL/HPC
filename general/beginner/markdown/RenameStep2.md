## Consider using heading levels to signify a breadcrumb trail of topics.

* Each top-level step should be relatively self-contained, and ideally persistent. So, install/setup/build/etc. are good, since one can leave off after one step, and pick right up at the next one.
* If possible, transient results like login/get-a-compute-node/etc. would be grouped under a larger topic to signify that one will have to start over again if all list items at that nested level aren't completed as a unit.

### Example

1. Obtain an account on NREL HPC
2. Install X and Y locally.
3. Prepare the Z environment on Peregrine
   a. Login to Peregrine  
   b. View software and get access to a compute node  
   c. First-time setup for Z on Peregrine  
4. Run example 1.
5. Run example 2.
6. Visualize examples 1 and 2.
