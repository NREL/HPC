# Level 1 heading for the top-level page on the topic.
A one-sentence summary of paragraph text, summarizing the purpose of the training or tutorial.

1. [Summary of step #1](RenameStep1.md)

2. [Summary of step #2](RenameStep2.md)

## Sometimes you might need a level-2 heading! If not, delete this.
### Sometimes you might need a level-3 heading! If not, delete this.
#### And so forth.

*Italic* text is considered emphasis, and uses _single_ asterisks or underscores.
**Bold** text is considered strong emphasis, and uses __double__ asterisks or underscores.
Emphases _can be **combined**_.
~~Strikethrough~~ text can be used inline if needed.

* Unordered
- lists
  * are
  - easy
* to make, if you take note of nested bullet alignment with the previous line in the plaintext file (in, e.g., vi).
- (As you can see, the characters you use as bullets are irrelevant to the renderer on Github.)

1. Ordered
2. lists  
   a. number  
   b. themselves (sometimes you'll need to add extra spaces after list items, otherwise
   c. separate items may render as concatenated).
3. when rendered, independent of what you type in raw text.

If you've got a lot of natural language to quote,

That is different from computer code, like
```
git status # To find added or changed files.
git add <new or changed file>
...
git commit -m 'Use comments to identify changes'
git push
```

On the other hand, `<inline code>` can be useful as well.

If for some reason a list of tasks is useful,
- [x] Make an unordered list with leading square brackets.
- [ ] Put a space in between the brackets for unfinished tasks.
- [x] Put an "x" in between the brackets for finished tasks.
- [ ] \(Escape leading parentheses with a backslash)
