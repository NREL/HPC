# intro-to-linux

If you havenâ€™t used a Linux system, here are some good online tutorials:

[HPC University - Introduction to Linux](hpcuniversity.org/trainingMaterials/31)

[Linux Command - Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)

Every year at the annual Supercomputing Conference, a group meets to discuss Best Practices in HPC Training.  This group developed a list of resources for training in HPC.  Please refer to their [Best Practices in HPC Training website](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/hpc-training-best-practices/training-resources).
