# Bash (***B***ourne ***A***gain ***Sh***ell) 

`bash` is the default shell application on NREL HPC systems and the terminal environment on many operating systems.

Bash has a lot of quirks; even for the experienced Bash wizard, there are a lot of caveats and odd syntax details to remember. We recommend all users take a look at our [writeup on bash](https://nrel.github.io/HPC/bash) for some explanation of some of Bash's idiosyncrasies and to get justification for why some of the notation is the way it is.

Afterwards, please see this very thorough and concise [cheatsheet that documents most of Bash's features](./cheatsheet.sh).
