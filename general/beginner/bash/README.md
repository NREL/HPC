# Bash (***B***ourne ***A***gain ***Sh***ell) 

`bash` is the default shell application on NREL HPC systems and the terminal environment on many operating systems.

Bash has a lot of quirks; even for the experienced Bash wizard, there are a lot of caveats and odd syntax details to remember. There is a nice introduction and a diagram of how the kernel, shell, and applications relate [here](https://www.educba.com/bash-shell-in-linux/). A more thorough treatment may be found at [tldp.org](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html). There is also a very brief [history of UNIX shells](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/1565923472/ch01s03.html) for context.

Afterwards, please see this very thorough and concise [cheatsheet that documents most of Bash's features](./cheatsheet.sh).
