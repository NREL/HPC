# COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE
##############################################################################


# The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last.
# There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`.

command  # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed
builtin  # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH
enable   # enables and disables shell built-ins

eval     # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again
