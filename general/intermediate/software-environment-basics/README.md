# software-environment-basics

Peregine uses [environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) to enable use of multiple software packages. There is a [detailed guide](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/peregrine-environment-modules.html) to finding and using modules.  The following guides show how to utilize the more complex modules:

1) [Anaconda](conda-how-to.md)

2) [Singularity](singularity-how-to.md)

EPEL is no longer supported for CentOS 7.  A singularity image with the CentOS 6 compute environment with EPEL has been set up in /nopt/nrel/apps/epel/centos6-epel.simg.  [Documentation and recipe](https://github.nrel.gov/hsorense/peregrine-singularity) exists to customize the image.
