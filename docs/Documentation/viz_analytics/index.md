#Visualization and Analytics Software Tools for Eagle System
Learn about the available visualization and analytics software tools to use with the Eagle system.

##VirtualGL/FastX
Provides remote visualization for OpenGL-based applications. For more information, see [using VirtualGL and FastX on the Eagle System](virtualgl_fastx.md).

##ParaView
An open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application. 
For information, see [using ParaView on the Eagle System](../Applications/paraview.md).

##Avizo
3D Analysis software for scientific and industrial data. For information, see [using Avizo software on the Eagle System](../Applications/avizo.md).

##VAPOR
VAPOR (Visualization and Analysis Platform for Ocean, Atmosphere, and Solar Researchers) enables interactive exploration of terascale gridded data sets that are large in both the spatial and temporal domains. Wavelet-based multiresolution data representation permits users to make speed/quality trade-offs for visual as well as non-visual data exploration tasks.

For more information see the [VAPOR website](https://www.vapor.ucar.edu/).

##R Statistical Computing Environment
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. For more information, see [running R on the Eagle System]().

##MATLAB
MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.

The name MATLAB stands for Matrix Laboratory. MATLAB was originally written to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects. Today, MATLAB engines incorporate the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, embedding the state of the art in software for matrix computation.

For more information, see [using MATLAB software on the Eagle System](../Applications/matlab.md). 

Interactive Data Language
IDL, the Interactive Data Language, is an interactive application used for data analysis, visualization and cross-platform application development.

##VisIt
VisIt is a free interactive parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool for viewing scientific data on Unix and PC platforms.  VisIt features a robust remote visualization capability. VisIt can be started on a local machine and used to visualize data on a remote compute cluster. 

For more information, see [using VisIt on the Eagle System](../Applications/visit.md).
