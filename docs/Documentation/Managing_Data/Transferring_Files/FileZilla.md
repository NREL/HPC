### Transferring Files

You may use FileZilla to transfer individual files or directories from the Local Directory to the Remote Directory or vice versa.

Transfer files by dragging them from the Local Directory (left pane) to the Remote Directory (right pane) or vice versa.  Once the transfer is complete the selected file will be visible in the pane it was transferred to.
