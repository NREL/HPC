# Compile and run: *MPI*

### Introduction
The ToolChains/Intel document goes into great detail on running with various settings and 
with the old and new versions of the Intel compilers.

The mpi/normal section of gpu[buildandrun](https://nrel.github.io/HPC/Documentation/Systems/Kestrel/Environments/gpubuildandrun/) shows how to build in run using the more standard version of MPI.
