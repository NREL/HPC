# Compile and run: *MPI*

### Introduction
The [ToolChains Intel](./intel.md) document goes into great detail on running with various settings and 
with the old and new versions of the Intel compilers.

The mpi/normal section of [gpubuildandrun](../gpubuildandrun.md) shows how to build and run using the more standard version of MPI.
