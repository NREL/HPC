Singularity is a platform designed specifically for running containers on HPC systems. 

!!! note
    Singularity has been deprecated in favor of a new container application called Apptainer, and NREL clusters now exclusively use Apptainer. This page has subsequently been deprecated. For more information about Apptainer and using it on NREL HPC systems, see [Apptainer](./apptainer.md).
