# ARM 

Arm Forge is a comprehensive software development suite designed to help software developers create, debug, and optimize high-performance applications for a wide range of platforms. It includes a set of tools that can be used separately or together, depending on the needs of the developer.

Arm Forge includes tools for:

1.	Memory Optimization (ARM [MAP](/Documentation/Development/Performance_Tools/ARM)): Arm Forge's memory profiler helps developers identify memory leaks and other memory-related issues in their code. It supports profiling of serial and parallel codes, MPI and OpenMP parallelism, and GPU-accelerated codes.
2.	Debugging (ARM [DDT](/Documentation/Development/Debug_Tools/)): Arm Forge's debugger allows developers to find and fix bugs in their code quickly and efficiently. It supports debugging of C, C++, and Fortran codes and includes features such as memory debugging, multi-threaded debugging, and MPI debugging.
3.	Performance Overviews (ARM [Performance Reports](/Documentation/Development/Performance_Tools/ARM/performance_rep)): Arm Forge's performance reports is a tool that provides high-level performance analysis of HPC applications, including MPI profiling, memory analysis, and thread profiling. This helps identify performance bottlenecks in their so they can and optimize it for better performance. It supports profiling of serial and parallel codes, MPI and OpenMP parallelism, and GPU-accelerated codes.
