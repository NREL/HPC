# Scientific Libraries Overview

Scientific math libraries are a collection of highly optimized software tools that provide functions and algorithms for performing mathematical operations commonly used in scientific applications. They provide developers with a variety of tools for solving complex problems. These libraries are highly optimized for performance and generally designed to be portable across different platforms and operating systems. 

We support some of the most widely used scientific math libraries including:

* MKL 
* LibSci (Kestrel only)
* FFTW 
* LAPACK
* scaLAPACK
* HDF5 
* PETSc

For details on how to build an application with scientific libraries, see our [how-to guide](howto.md)

For more information on a given scientific library, see our individual library pages under our "Libraries" drop-down menu.
