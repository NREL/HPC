# Lex Allocation Management System (Beta)
*Lex is a system for managing your high-performance computing (HPC) resource assignments, account information, and tracking utilization.*


## Access

An [NREL HPC account](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/user-accounts.html) is required to access Lex. To log in to Lex, open a web browser to [https://hpcprojects.nrel.gov](https://hpcprojects.nrel.gov/login/?next=/). Log in with your NREL HPC username and password. An OTP token is not required to authenticate. 

## Managing Users

The allocation PI, Project Lead, and Alternate Project Lead can use Lex to manage the allocation entitlement list. 

To add and remove users, navigate to the "Manage Users" page for the allocation.

To add users, click the "Add User" button and enter the user's email. Repeat for any additional users. Click "Delete" to remove users from the allocation entitlement list.
**Be sure to click "Submit Changes" to apply your changes.**

Users who have an existing NREL HPC account will be added to the allocation group and permissions will be granted within 24 hours. 
Otherwise, they will be sent an email invitation to request an account and will be listed in the "Pending Invitations" list until their account has been created. You can cancel an invitation by selecting the "Cancel" button and clicking "Submit Changes". 

## Tracking Allocation Usage

### AU Usage Data 

The sidebar on the Lex homepage shows all of the allocations that you have access to. Select a project to check the resource usage.

On the "AU Use Report" page, the "Project Use" section lists all of the systems that the project has an allocation on and corresponding AU usage. The "AUs Charged by User" section provides a breakdown of AU usage by user for the project. By default, the data displayed shows each user's total usage across all systems. To filter this to show data for a specific system, use the system button as shown below.
