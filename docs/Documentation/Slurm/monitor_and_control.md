# Commands to Monitor and Control Jobs

Slurm includes a suite of command-line tools used to submit, monitor, and control jobs and the job queue.


| Command | Description |
| ----------| ------------ | 
| ```squeue``` | Show the Slurm queue. Users can specify JOBID or USER.|
| ```scontrol``` | 	Controls various aspects of jobs such as job suspension, re-queuing or resuming jobs and can display diagnostic info about each job.|
| ```scancel``` | Cancel specified job(s). |
| ```sinfo``` | View information about all Slurm nodes and partitions. |
| ```sacct``` | Detailed information on accounting for all jobs and job steps. |
| ```sprio``` | View priority and the factors that determine scheduling priority. |

Please see ```man``` pages on the cluster for more information on each command. Also see ```--help``` or ```--usage``` flags for each.

Our [Presentation on Advanced Slurm Features](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/assets/pdfs/slurm-advanced-topics.pdf) is also available as a resource, which has supplementary information on how to manage jobs.

Another great resource for Slurm at NREL is [this repository on Github](https://github.com/sayerhs/nrel-eagle/blob/master/nrel-eagle.md).

## Usage Examples

### squeue

The `squeue` command is used to view the current state of jobs in the queue. 

To show your jobs:

```
$ squeue -u hpcuser
           JOBID    PARTITION       NAME      USER   ST       TIME      NODES   NODELIST(REASON)
          506955          gpu   wait_tes   hpcuser   PD       0:00          1      (Resources)
```

To show all jobs in the queue with extended information:

```
$ squeue -l
Thu Dec 13 12:17:31 2018
 JOBID  PARTITION NAME     USER     STATE   TIME    TIME_LIMIT   NODES  NODELIST(REASON)

 516702 standard Job002    user4    RUNNING 4:16:50 15:00:00      71    r1i6n35,r1i7n[0-35],r2i0n[0-33]
 516703 standard Job003    user4    RUNNING 4:16:57 15:00:00      71    r1i5n[0-35],r1i6n[0-34]
 516893 standard Job004    user4    RUNNING 7:19     3:00:00      71    r1i1n35,r1i2n[0-35],r1i3n[0-33]
 516894 standard Job005    user4    RUNNING 7:19     3:00:00      71    r4i2n[20-25],r6i6n[7-35],r6i7n[0-35]
 516895 standard Job006    user4    RUNNING 7:19     3:00:00      71    r4i2n[29-35],r4i3n[0-35],r4i4n[0-20]

```

To estimate when your jobs will start to run, use the ```squeue --start``` command with the JOBID.

Note that the Slurm start times are only an estimate, and are updated frequently based on the current state of the queue and the specified `--time` of all jobs in the queue. 

```

$ squeue --start -j 509851,509852
 JOBID    PARTITION    NAME      USER      ST          START_TIME    NODES   SCHEDNODES   NODELIST(REASON)
 509851   short      test1.sh   hpcuser    PD                 N/A      100       (null)       (Dependency)
 509852   short      test2.sh   hpcuser    PD 2018-12-19T16:54:00        1      r1i6n35         (Priority)
 
```

#### Output Customization of the squeue Command

The displayed fields in `squeue` can be highly customized to display the information that's most relevant for the user by using the `-o` or `-O` flags. The full list of customizable fields can be found under the entries for these flags in the `man squeue` command on the system. 

By setting the environment variable export $SQUEUE_FORMAT, you can override the system's default squeue fields with your own. For example, if you run the following line (or place it in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases` file to make it persistent across logins):

`export SQUEUE_FORMAT="%.18i %.15P %.8q %.12a %.8p %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"`

Using `squeue` will now provide the formatted output:

```
JOBID    PARTITION   QOS    ACCOUNT   PRIORITY     NAME     USER    ST     TIME    NODES NODELIST(REASON)
13141110 standard   normal  csc000    0.051768    my_job   hpcuser  R   2-04:01:17   1    r1i3n29
```

Or you may wish to add the `%V` to show the timestamp that a job was submitted, and sort by timestamp, ascending:

`squeue -o "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %20V %6q %12l %R" -S "V"`

Example output:

```
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES SUBMIT_TIME          QOS    TIME_LIMIT   NODELIST(REASON)

```

Many other options are available in the `man` page.


### scontrol
To get detailed information about your job before and while it runs, you may use `scontrol show job` with the JOBID.  For example:
```
$ scontrol show job 522616
JobId=522616 JobName=myscript.sh
 UserId=hpcuser(123456) GroupId=hpcuser(123456) MCS_label=N/A
 Priority=43295364 Nice=0 Account=csc000 QOS=normal
 JobState=PENDING Reason=Dependency Dependency=afterany:522615
```
The ```scontrol``` command can also be used to modify pending and running jobs:
```
$ scontrol update jobid=526501 qos=high
$ sacct -j 526501 --format=jobid,partition,state,qos
       JobID  Partition      State        QOS
------------ ---------- ---------- ----------
526501            short    RUNNING       high
526501.exte+               RUNNING
526501.0                 COMPLETED
```
To pause a job: ```scontrol hold <JOBID>```

To resume a job: ```scontrol resume <JOBID>```

To cancel and rerun: ```scontrol requeue <JOBID>```

### scancel 
Use ```scancel -i <jobID>``` for an interactive mode to confirm each job_id.step_id before performing the cancel operation. Use ```scancel --state=PENDING,RUNNING,SUSPENDED -u <userid>``` to cancel your jobs by STATE or ```scancel -u <userid>``` to cancel ALL of your jobs.

### sinfo
Use ```sinfo``` to view cluster information:
```
$ sinfo -o %A
NODES(A/I)
2299/140
```
Above, ```sinfo``` shows nodes Allocated (A) and nodes idle (I) in the entire cluster.

To check the state of nodes in a partition (for example, 'gpu-h100' on Kestrel), you can run:

```
$ sinfo -o "%A %t" -p gpu-h100

```
This will return the number of nodes associated with a given state ('idle', 'mix', 'alloc', etc.) at that moment. 'Idle' indicates nodes that are free, 'alloc' refers to fully allocated nodes, and 'mix' represents nodes that are not fully allocated and could accept jobs requesting less than a full nodeâ€™s resources. *Note*: a 'mix' node state is only valid for shareable partitions. 

To see specific node information use ```sinfo -n <node id>``` to show information about a single or comma-separated list of nodes. You will see the partition to which the node can allocate as well as the node STATE.
```

```
### sacct
Use ```sacct``` to view accounting information about jobs AND job steps:
```
$ sacct -j 7379855 --format=User,JobID,Jobname,partition,state,time,start,elapsed,nnodes,ncpus
     User JobID           JobName  Partition      State  Timelimit               Start    Elapsed   NNodes      NCPUS

```
Use ```sacct -e``` to print a list of fields that can be specified with the ```--format``` option.
### sprio 
By default, ```sprio``` returns information for all pending jobs. Options exist to display specific jobs by JOBID and USER.
```
$ sprio -u hpcuser
  JOBID PARTITION     USER   PRIORITY       SITE        AGE  FAIRSHARE    JOBSIZE  PARTITION        QOS
8571640     short  hpcuser   38940102          0          0   35071134      45319    3823650          0

Use the `-n` flag to provide a normalized priority weighting with a value between 0-1:

$ sprio -u hpcuser -n
  JOBID PARTITION     USER    PRIORITY       AGE  FAIRSHARE    JOBSIZE  PARTITION  QOS       
8571680     short  hpcuser  0.00906644 0.0000000  0.0881939  0.0002043  0.1000000  0.0000000
```

The `sprio` command also has some options that can be used to view the entire queue by priority order. The following command will show the "long" (`-l`) format sprio with extended information, sorted by priority in descending order (`-S -Y`), and piped through the `less` command with line numbers shown on the far left (`less -N`):

`sprio -S -Y -l | less -N`

```
1           JOBID PARTITION     USER   PRIORITY       SITE        AGE      ASSOC  FAIRSHARE    JOBSIZE  PARTITION        QOS        NICE                 TRES
2        13150512 standard-  hpcuser  373290120          0    8909585          0  360472143      84743    3823650          0           0
3        13150514 standard-  hpcuser  373290070          0    8909534          0  360472143      84743    3823650          0           0
```

When `sprio` is piped through the `less` command for paginating, press the `/` key and type in a jobid or a username and press the return key to search for and jump to that jobid or username. Press `/` and hit return again to search for the next occurrence of your search term, or use the `?` instead of `/` to search upwards in the list. Press q to exit.

Note that when piped through `less -N`, line numbers may be equated to position in the priority queue plus 1, because the top column label line of `sprio` is counted by `less`. To remove the column labels from `sprio` output, add the `-h` or `--noheader` flag to `sprio`.

The `-l`(`--long`) flag precludes using the `-n` for normalized priority values. 

Like `squeue` and other Slurm commands, `sprio` supports the `-o` format flag to customize the columns that are displayed. For example:

`sprio S -Y -o "%i %r %u %y"`

Will show only the jobid, partition, username, and normalized priority. More details about output formatting are available in `man sprio`.
