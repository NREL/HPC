# Visualization and Analytics Software Tools 

*Learn about the available visualization and analytics software tools*

## VirtualGL/FastX

Provides remote visualization for OpenGL-based applications. For more information, see [using VirtualGL and FastX ](virtualgl_fastx.md).

## ParaView

An open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application. 
For information, see [using ParaView](paraview.md).

## R Statistical Computing Environment

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. For more information, see [running R](../Development/Languages/r.md).

## MATLAB

MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.

The name MATLAB stands for Matrix Laboratory. MATLAB was originally written to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects. Today, MATLAB engines incorporate the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, embedding the state of the art in software for matrix computation.

For more information, see [using MATLAB software](../Applications/Matlab/index.md). 

## VisIt

VisIt is a free interactive parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool for viewing scientific data on Unix and PC platforms.  VisIt features a robust remote visualization capability. VisIt can be started on a local machine and used to visualize data on a remote compute cluster. 

For more information, see [using VisIt](visit.md).
