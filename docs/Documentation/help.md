## Microsoft Teams
Each system has a Microsoft Teams channel where users can collaborate and post questions. The Swift and Vermilion Team chats are one of the primary ways we communicate announcements and status updates for these systems. 

We update the our members annually from the project team list. However, if we missed you and you would like to join, please use the following instructions:
