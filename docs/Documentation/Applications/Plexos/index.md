# PLEXOS

*PLEXOS is a simulation software for modeling electric, gas, and water systems for optimizing energy markets.* 

Users can run PLEXOS models on NREL's computing clusters. However, users need to build the PLEXOS models on a Windows system as there is no GUI available on the clusters and on Linux in general
