# Using MATLAB Software

*Learn how to use MATLAB software on the NREL HPC systems.*

### [Running MATLAB in Batch Mode](batch.md)

Details on how to run MATLAB scripts in batch mode. Steps are illustrated by a
simple example.

### [Running MATLAB Interactively](interactive.md)

How to run interactively using either a terminal or FastX.

### [Using the Parallel Computing Toolbox](parallel.md)

Toolbox used to run parallel MATLAB code on a single, multi-core compute
node. Use of the toolbox is demonstrated via a parallel "hello world" example
and a Monte Carlo example that leverages MATLAB's parfor command.

### [Understanding Versions and Licenses](versions.md)

Learn about the MATLAB software versions and licenses available for use.
