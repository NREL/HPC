brief: Eagle Storage Policies, FY22 Begins in October

# Reminder of Eagle Data Storage Policies for FY21 projects ending 9/30/2021
Eagle usage policies can be found at: [HPC Policies](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/policies.html)

Users are always strongly encouraged to remove any data on Eaglefs that is not needed, to benefit other users of this shared resource.

In summary, data in /projects for allocations that end on 9/30/2021 will be purged on 12/31/2021.

Users may continue to log in to HPC systems for a period of 3 months after the project enters the Expired state to move relevant data off of HPC primary storage (primarily /projects/<project_id>) to another storage location.

Users may continue to request  MSS (Mass Storage System) files that have been archived, for a period of 15 months after the files have been initially archived.

Eagle's /scratch files have a policy of potentially being purged if not accessed within 28 days.

Please contact the HPC Help Desk with any questions at <hpc-help@nrel.gov>

# October is the start of the 2022 allocation year
Scheduling will be paused on Eagle on October 1st to implement the new allocations.
