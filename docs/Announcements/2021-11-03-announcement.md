brief: Eagle Storage Policies, Fast Queue Times

# Reminder of Eagle Data Storage Policies for FY21 projects that ended on 9/30/2021
Eagle usage policies can be found at: [https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/policies.html](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/policies.html)
Users are always strongly encouraged to remove any data on Eaglefs that is not needed, to benefit other users of this shared resource. Eaglefs consists of /shared-projects, /datasets, /scratch and /projects.

In summary, data in /projects for allocations that end on 9/30/2021 will be purged after 12/31/2021.

Users may continue to log in to HPC systems for a period of 3 months after the project enters the Expired state to move relevant data off of HPC primary storage (primarily /projects/<project_handle>) to another storage location. The ability to write new data to /projects has been disabled for those projects that have expired. Instructions on how to archive data using AWS MSS (Mass Storage System) can be found here.

Users may continue to request MSS files that have been archived, for a period of 15 months after the files have been initially archived.  Eagle's /scratch files have a policy of potentially being purged if not accessed within 28 days.
 
# Fast Eagle Queue Times
Eagle is now one month into the FY22 allocation cycle, and many projects are still in the process of preparing their software, data, and experiments. For those who are prepared to start computational work right away, though, now is a great opportunity to submit your jobs and beat the quarterly rush.
Please also keep in mind that Allocation Units (AUs) are a function of how many hours there are in a year. In other words, an AU that goes unspent now cannot be saved for later, it is lost forever--so start your computational work on Eagle as early as possible in the allocation cycle.
