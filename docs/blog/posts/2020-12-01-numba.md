# Speeding up python Code with Numba

Numba is a just in time (JIT) compiler for Python and NumPy code. From their official website, "Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN."

```python
@jit(nopython=True)
def function_to_be_compiled():
	# Standard numerical/NumPy code here
	...
```

Importantly, many functions require *no changes or refactoring* to gain this speedup.  In this [getting-started guide](https://github.com/NREL/HPC/blob/master/languages/python/numba/numba_demo.ipynb), we build an example environment on Eagle, test the performance of a Numba-compiled function using the most common implementation of the `@jit` decorator, and discuss what sorts of functions will see performance improvements when compiled.
