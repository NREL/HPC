# Running Python 2 code on Eagle

While [Python 2 was sunset on January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/),
there is still legacy code or modules that may need to be run on Eagle. We always encourage
Eagle users to upgrade their code to Python 3.x. But we do understand that there will always
be code that is not worth porting to Python 3. In those cases here are some options you have

1. [*Set up a custom Python 2 environment*](2022-05-11-python2to3.md#1-set-up-a-custom-python-2-environment-using-conda-or-containers)
2. [*Find an alternative tool that fits your needs*](2022-05-11-python2to3.md#2-find-an-alternative-tool-that-fits-your-needs)
3. [*Convert Python 2 code to Python 3*](2022-05-11-python2to3.md#3-convert-python-2-code-to-python-3)


## 1. Set up a custom Python 2 environment using Conda or Containers

It is best to create this python environment within [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). 
This conda environment can be made even more portable by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org).
Currently, [Eagle only supports Apptainer](https://nrel.github.io/HPC/Documentation/Software_Tools/Containers/).
Subsequently, the outputs of the Python 2 code can be incorporated, e.g., using a file-based approach.

It is possible to run legacy Python 2 code in parallel within a container or a conda environment, but your mileage may vary.


## 2. Find an alternative tool that fits your needs

There are usually multiple alternatives to your software of concern that have the same or slightly different features.
Some of the potential advantages and disadvantages **include**

**Advantages**

   1. If they are written in Python 3, they are newer and might offer better software support.
   2. They allow for efficient parallelism, enabling better use of Eagle.
   3. Leverages Python 3 features and packages, e.g., Abstract Base Classes.

**Disadvantages**

   1. It may break your build environment.
   2. It may require a significant code rewrite to extract the best performance.
   3. Additional code may need to be written if the alternative does not have all the features as the Python 2 software.


## 3. Convert Python 2 code to Python 3

This is an option when the Python 2 code under consideration does not have a lot of dependencies, you have the source code, and the software license allows you to make changes to the source code. 
For scientific software, we do encourage developers to make this version jump as this enables code longevitiy and accessibility.
Several online resource are available to enable porting your code to Python 3.
Some of them include:

   1. [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)
   2. [THe Conservative Python 3 Porting Guide](https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   3. [Supporting Python 3: An in-depth guide](http://python3porting.com)
   4. [Python FAQ: How do I port to Python 3?](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/07/31/python-faq-how-do-i-port-to-python-3/)
   5. [How to Port Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-port-python-2-code-to-python-3)

Note that the above is not an exhasutive list and we encourage the user to look at other resources as well.
Additionally, depending on the needs of your project, you can also reach out to [HPC-Help@nrel.gov](mailto:HPC-Help@nrel.gov) to help with this port.
