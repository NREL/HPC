 Compile our program
 Here we use mpiCC which uses Nvidia's version of MPI and
 their backend compiler. The "hpcx" has a few more optimizations.

: We run with 2 tasks total.
: This version of MPI does not support srun so we use mpirun

echo Run on a single node
mpirun -n 2 -N 2 ./staged

echo Run on two nodes 
mpirun -n 2 -N 1 ./staged
