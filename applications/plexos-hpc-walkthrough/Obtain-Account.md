## Obtain an Account on the HPC

In order to run PLEXOS and COAD on the HPC you will need an account on the HPC System, Peregrine.

As part of the MSPCM Workshop, you should have received an email with details concerning your account on the HPC.  If you need help with your account email hpc-help@nrel.gov. In addition, you will need to connect to the NREL guest wireless while at the workshop in order to login into the HPC system.

The general instructions for obtaining an account are found on the [NREL HPC website](https://hpc.nrel.gov/users/accounts).
