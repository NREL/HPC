    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo illustrates several important concepts about parallel computing with Dask:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Lazy Evaluation**\n",
    "- Dask builds a computation graph before executing anything\n",
    "- This allows for optimization and parallel execution planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Automatic Parallelization**\n",
    "- Independent tasks can run simultaneously across multiple CPU cores\n",
    "- Dask handles task scheduling and resource management automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Scalability Benefits**\n",
    "- Small tasks (like our 3-operation example) may not show dramatic speedups due to overhead\n",
    "- Larger workloads (like our 100-operation example) demonstrate significant performance gains\n",
    "- Real-world data processing tasks with thousands or millions of operations see even greater benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Easy Integration**\n",
    "- Minimal code changes required to parallelize existing Python workflows\n",
    "- Works seamlessly with NumPy, Pandas, and other scientific Python libraries"
