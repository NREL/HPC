# HPC Python
A collection of modules and tools for developing HPC Python scripts. These resources enable python to utilize a GPU or multi-node execution. 

## Resources
* [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) 
    * [Dask-MPI](https://github.com/dask/dask-mpi) deploy workers across MPI ranks.
* [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)
* [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy): GPU accelerated NumPy implementation
* [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf): GPU accelerated dataframes, efficient for use with strings and numerics.
* [MPI4Py](https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py) Python MPI bindings
* [UCX-Py](https://ucx-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): UCX bindings to take advantage of NVLINK or Infiniband
