    "# Distributed JuMP Optimization Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Distributed.jl to solve multiple independent JuMP optimization problems in parallel, each on a different Julia process. Each problem is a simple linear program (LP) with a linear objective, variable bounds, and linear constraints. The notebook collects the optimal objective values from each process and displays them.\n",

    "- Each optimization uses a different starting point\n",
    "- Uses JuMP and Ipopt as the solver\n",
    "- Can be run on a single machine or across multiple nodes in an HPC environment\n",
    "- Uses the Project.toml environment provided"
