# Eagle Outage

Eagle will be taking an outage on March 2nd. We will be making time critical hardware repairs 
to the Lustre file system and doing some security patching. Small tweaks are being made to slurm to 
reduce the amount of advertised memory and reduce the number of E-cells jobs run on.  Both should make 
nodes and jobs more reliable and increase performance for larger jobs.


#Jupyterhub Documentation
We have written up a how-to guide for using the Europa Jupyterhub server, including setting up custom Python, 
Julia, and R kernels and interacting with Eagle. See [https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/jupyterhub.html](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/jupyterhub.html) for more.

# ESIF-HPC-3 Project Update
We have pushed the proposal deadline out to February 18th and expect to have reviews completed sometime 
in mid-April. We have been fielding questions from various interested offerors, and are looking forward 
to seeing what they've got!
