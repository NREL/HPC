# ESIF-HPC-3 Project Update
The ESIF-HPC-3 project has begun! The effort to acquire Eagle’s successor involves ongoing engagement with stakeholders (EERE, Lab Program Management, and the HPC user community), tracking industry trends, analysis of Eagle’s workload over its life to date, external design review, and a carefully managed Request for Proposals targeted for release later this year. We are currently in the process of completing the draft technical specifications for the ESIF-HPC-3 system, and are targeting the start of FY23 for general production access.
