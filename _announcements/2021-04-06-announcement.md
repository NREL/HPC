# Eagle File System Usage
The Lustre file systems that hosts /projects and /scratch works most efficiently when it is under 80% full. Please do your part to 
keep the file system under 80% by cleaning up your /projects and /scratch spaces. 

# Eagle System Time
Eagle will have a system time for a work week starting May 3rd. There will be a power outage in the data center at this time, and 
we will need to do some work on Eagle as well. 

# FY22 HPC Allocation Process
The Eagle allocation process for FY22 will open up in May, with applications due in June (the exact dates are still to be decided.) The 
application process will be very similar to FY21. HPC Operations will again host a seminar to explain the application process. Watch 
this space for announcements.

# FY22 Cloud Allocation Process
HPC and Cloud are both supported by Advanced Computing Operations (ACO) in the Computational Sciences Center. We are aligning the 
request process for both computing and cloud resources. 

The Cloud allocation process for FY22 will open up in May, with applications due in June (the exact dates are still to be decided.)  The 
annual allocation process for cloud resources will be updated this year, and a new web interface will be provided for submitting your 
request. Cloud allocations have a different funding model from high performance computing: baseline services and administration of the
cloud environment is funded by NREL, and project-specific computing and services is funded directly by the project. This means itâ€™s 
important to work with the cloud team to determine your needs in the cloud and to generate cost estimates for your project. Requests 
for cloud resources are reviewed and approved by the IACAC.

Watch for the Call for Requests notification, and attend the upcoming Cloud Allocation Request webinar in May to learn more!

# Coming Soon: New Cloud User Website
We are transitioning from the CSC Cloud Team Wiki to a website modeled after hpc.nrel.gov. The website will have a similar 
structure and look and feel that the user community is accustomed to.
