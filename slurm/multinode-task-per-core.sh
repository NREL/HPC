Example of mapping an echo command to each core on an arbitrary amount
of nodes using slurm. Each node on Eagle has 36 cores, so there should
be an entry for 36 * N CPU ranks in the job output.

USAGE: sbatch â€“A <project_handle> -N <node amount> multinode-task-per-core.sh

PROCS=$(($SLURM_NNODES * $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE)) # Number of CPUs * number of nodes

# master node in jobs with N > 1 runs these
echo "I am node $SLURMD_NODENAME and I am the master node of this job with ID $SLURM_NODEID"
echo "There are $SLURM_NNODES nodes in this job, and each has $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE cores, for a total of $PROCS cores."
printf "Let's get each node in the job to introduce itself:\n\n"

# Send an in-line bash script to each node to run. The single quotes prevent $var evaluation.
# `srun` uses all resources by default
srun bash <<< 'printf "\tI am $SLURMD_NODENAME, my ID for this job is $SLURM_NODEID\n"' &
wait

# Do the same, but get each node to get each core to print its "rank" (unique index)

Example Output

I am node r5i0n13 and I am the master node of this job with ID 0
There are 2 nodes in this job, and each has 36 cores, for a total of 72 cores.
Let's get each node in the job to introduce itself:

	I am r5i0n14, my ID for this job is 1
	I am r5i0n13, my ID for this job is 0

Let's get each node to print the ranks of all their cores (concurrently!):
