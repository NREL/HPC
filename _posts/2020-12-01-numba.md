# Speeding up Python Code with Numba

Numba is a just in time (JIT) compiler for Python and NumPy code. From their official website, "Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN."

```python
@jit(nopython=True)
def function_for_compilation():
	# Numerical/NumPy code here
	...
```

In this [getting-started guide](https://github.com/NREL/HPC/blob/hpc-python/languages/python/numba/numba_demo.ipynb), we build an example environment on Eagle, test the performance of a Numba-compiled function using the most common implementation of the `@jit` decorator, and discuss what sorts of functions will see performance improvements when compiled.
